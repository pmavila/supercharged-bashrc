# supercharged-bashrc (WIP)

This is a comprehensive `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` for linux command prompt with colorful output and lots of useful aliases and functions taken from different popular sources, specifically made in a [lubuntu 20.04](https://lubuntu.me/) environment.

*This is not a direct fork of slomkowski's bash-full-of-colors but rather a combination of that and Emmanuel Rouat's [.bashrc sample](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html)*
